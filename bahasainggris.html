						Text for question 13 to15.</br>
						Dear, Rosa</br>
						I am a guy, twenty-eight years old. I have a problem with a girl friend. She is twenty five years old. We have been dating each other for years, since we were high school students. Now we have jobs. I feel very sure that we love each other. Now it is time for me to get married. Unfortunately, her parents never approve of our relationship ever since the very first time. My family, anyhow, does not really mind. At first I thought my girl friend had the power to defend our love. But then she surrendered. She loves, me and she loves her family, too. On the one hand she said, "I'll be happy if my family is happy." It means she had to get approval from her parents.</br>
						For this I was shocked. My heart was broken. She ended our relationship just at the time when I was ready to marry her. When I was with her, we were very happy. We had a lot in common and there were no conflicts. The truth was, we separated only because of her parents. They want her to marry her cousin, her aunt's son (this is one of the traditions in the Karonese).</br>
						For the time being I am very upset. When I miss her I call her. Then we can eat together, talk together for hours. We act like elating because she loves me, too. The real problem is, she cannot refuse what her parents want. So, should I forget my girl friend, the only one that I truly love? Or else, should I just wait, and dream that one day she will be back to me?</br>
						Rio N., Padang</br>
						Dear Rio,</br>
						You call her your girl friend, but she has chosen her own way. For this reason Iâ€™d, say that there is nothingyou can do except forget her and go on with your normal life. Hopefully you can find another and livehappily forever.</br>
